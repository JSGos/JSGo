The code is responsible for identifying unit testing code that reaches the target code and generating execution traces of these reachable test cases. The reachable execution traces are stored in `refAlignTraces`.

**Requirements:**
Before run the Python code, you need to add a `testonly` entry to the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file. The `testonly` value can be either "Jasmine", "Jest", or "Mocha", etc. Make sure that when typing `npm run testonly`, the application's provided test suites will be successfully executed.

**Usage:**
Run `getRefInput.py`, `ins_helper.py`, and `getRefTraceAligned.py` with the appropriate arguments.

**Example:**
An example usage is provided in `parser-server-example.sh`.
The results of running this example is stored in `example_results_refAlignTraces`.
